# flutter_assignment

This is the first Flutter Assignment from Udemy Course.

Challenge is to : 

1) Create a new Flutter App (in this project) and output an AppBar and some text below it.
2) Add a button which changes the text (to any other text of your choice).
3) Split the app into three widgets: App, TextControl & Text.

I have succesfully completed the Challenge.
